msgid "Production ready IoT systems require a sophisticated and robust infrastructure. There are a multitude of services and open source technologies that allow the realisation of such systems with minimal effort. In practice however, and especially in the manufacturing domain, it proves difficult to bring these technologies into production and as a result the shop floor cannot benefit from the advantages of the IoT. Working in close cooperation with small and medium sized manufacturers, we have identified several key issues they face when dropping the monolithic approach and adopting IoT technologies and an IoT mindset:"

msgid "By incorporating key software engineering concepts (versioning, containerisation, continuous integration, continuous deployment, App runtime environment) the proposed architecture aims at giving manufacturers a ready to use infrastructure with the ingredients for a healthy and flexible software eco-system on the shop floor. We believe that the design principles listed below are central to a shop floor architecture that supports IIoT applications:"
